# smart-remind-csci440
The purpose of this project is to create a program that sets up and manages events and organizes groups. As we can say, remembering events are always important. And our focus is to make a reminder app to make it easier for the user. There are a lot of reminder apps out there, but we are going to add our own twist to ours. This project will be able to send intelligent reminders to users and groups and this will be done by adding dependencies and using a strong database such as MySQL.
